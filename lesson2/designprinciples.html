            <P>This page exemplifies excellent contrast not only between the background and foreground but through its ability to highlight vibrant pictures as well as balance the colors of the text and page as a whole.The lack of colors gives viewers the ability to relax and enjoy the content.</P>

            <h2>White space & clean design</h2>

            <img src="images/whiteboard_white.png" alt="Screenshot of Whiteboard whitespace"> 
            <P>The whitespace on this page allows you to focus on the words on this site, which is what drives the content. The words are the most important and engaging thing and the design is constructed around it. The extra whitespace highlights and prevents extra distraction that could possibly result if more colors were added and filled up the extra space.</P>
